## Day 1

Language: Rust

For Day 1, I randomly decided to implement it in Rust. I have been wanting to try out Rust for a long time and decided to finally bite the bullet.

First impression. Wow, this documentaiton is great! Cargo is great! Everything is built in and decided for you! No one's opinion matters! I'm getting some weird EmberJS nostalgia!

Ok, does this work? Maybe I need to read the docs more...

I found myself struggling with some concepts as it is quite verbose. Types are not as clear as C++ or Java, but there is so many things done well in the ecosystem that I will definitely need to work with this again in the future.
