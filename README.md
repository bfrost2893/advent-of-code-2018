## Day 1

**Language: Rust**

For Day 1, I randomly decided to implement it in Rust. I have been wanting to try out Rust for a long time and decided to finally bite the bullet.

First impression. Wow, this documentaiton is great! Cargo is great! Everything is built in and decided for you! No one's opinion matters! I'm getting some weird EmberJS nostalgia!

Ok, does this work? Maybe I need to read the docs more...

I found myself struggling with some concepts as it is quite verbose. Types are not as clear as C++ or Java, but there is so many things done well in the ecosystem that I will definitely need to work with this again in the future.

## Day 2

**Language: Go**

For Day 2 I used Go. The first thing I didn't like about Go was the setup. It was strange that I had to set the `$GOPATH` env variable. I decided to keep Day 2 in this repo, so I set it with a shell script instead of keeping all projects in the same dir. If there's another way of doing this, it was not mentioned on the golang website.

Besides that, I found the syntax easy to read/understand. Even though my project was small and probably not a good judge, dev iterations were quick which is always a plus. There was a decent amount of convenience methods and the types were consistent with other languages. I also really like the `go fmt` tool.

Also my algorithm was terrible for Part 2. Don't hate me.
